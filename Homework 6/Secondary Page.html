  <p><i>Reads the stamped words on the front of the folder on Colour Field's desk. After opening it, she reads the following:</i></p>

  <p>[8/16/1018]</p>

  <p>Suspicious activity detected in Hindian waters - destroyer sonar picked up neigh-undetectable pings of a single object thousands of meters down approximately 885 clicks east of Sri Cervidae. Small destroyer group perused the pings. Pings were lost within an hour due to mild sonar malfunction; submarines ordered to be on standby by the admiral incase incident repeats. All sonars to be checked for flaws.</p>

  <p>[8/27/1018]</p>

  <P>Small cruiser patrol detected three moving vessels along the floor of the Warm Sea, sudden sonar malfunctions resulted in losing track of the objects before submarines could arrive. Further analysis of sonars for flaws is advised.</P>

  <p>[9/4/1018]</p>
  
  <p>Lone destroyer in the Warm Sea, on edge of Panthalassic Ocean picked up one moving vessel near the sea floor. Sonar did not malfunction so the destroyer was able to track the vessel for hours. Two submarines arrived and dove in pursuit of the vessel. Sonar equipment caught fire shortly after entering a 1.3 kilometer radius of the vessel, severely damaging the submarines and forcing them to break pursuit. Cause of fire was indeterminable upon return to port.</p>

  <p>One officer suspects intentional sabotage of sonar systems via unknown means, possibly originating from the vessels themselves. Further investigation is highly recommended as these vessels were in our waters. We leave the choice to you, commander.</p>
